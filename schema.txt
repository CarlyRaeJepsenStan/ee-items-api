For attributes.db, the schema is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Attributes
(
  [Name] VARCHAR(4000)  NOT NULL,
  [ID] INTEGER  NOT NULL

);
```
varchar can store unicode (like chinese characters), but uses more space.


For en_ and zh_descriptions.db, it's similar:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Descriptions
(
  [Content] VARCHAR(4000)  NOT NULL,
  [ID] INTEGER  NOT NULL

);
```

For items.db (with Chinese names and desc):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Items
(
  [Name] VARCHAR(4000)  NOT NULL,
  [Description] VARCHAR(4000)  NOT NULL,
  [ID] INTEGER  NOT NULL
);
```

Useful data (attributes stats etc) is generated on demand.  Item IDs common between
items/##.json and dogma/type_attributes_##.json are stored in loc.db with a reference
to their location (10100000101 is in [snip]/dogma/type_attributes_0.json, for example),
and when a request is made, the scripts will search for the file and read the object out of the file.

This is the schema for loc.db:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Locations
(
  [ID] INTEGER  NOT NULL,
  [Path] VARCHAR(4000)  NOT NULL
);
```
